Measurement and accounting tools refer to calculators and formulas and are not to be confused with standards, benchmarks, or thresholds for achievement (to be discussed in <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch09#landrum_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Next Steps: Sustainability Strategy"</a>). These measurement and accounting tools allow the company to measure its current behavior to establish a baseline, to set goals for improvement, and to measure future behavior to determine progress. This chapter will introduce you to the most common tools used by sustainable businesses.</p>

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol</a><span class="glossdef">A guide for companies in creating base-year measurements of GHG emission, both direct and indirect, which allows companies to determine their future goals for reduction.</span></span> was jointly created by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainability.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn08_003">World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (2004, 2005).</span> The GHG Protocol guides a company in creating base year measurements of GHG emissions, both direct and indirect, and allows the company to determine its own future goals for reduction. No comparative threshold or standard is provided. This tool can be used to implement the ISO 14064 standard on GHG emissions, and work currently underway will soon show how the GHG Protocol can be used with the Kyoto Protocol.Although there are a plethora of online carbon calculators available to companies, they do not measure the full scope of emissions as detailed in the GHG Protocol.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Life Cycle Assessments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_s01_s05_p01">Life cycle analyses (or assessments, LCAs) are another tool used to measure the environmental impact of a company’s performance related to one specific product or service. LCAs do not assess the overall environmental performance of a company; they are focused only on the product or process under review. Nonetheless, LCA is a useful measurement tool for the sustainable business to help determine impacts of various products and services. Please refer to <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch05#landrum_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Research and Development"</a> for further discussion on applications of LCA.</p>
