    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_p02">The intersection of sustainability and finance occurs on many fronts. In this chapter, we will discuss how sustainability impacts various activities associated with the finance function, such as investments, banking, trading, insurance, and more. The chapter starts with capital investments, which are long-term corporate finance decisions related to fixed assets and capital structure. The discussion of the valuation techniques centers on the inclusion of sustainability measures in the analysis. Green and socially responsible investment opportunities, such as green bonds and emissions trading, are explored in the financial investment section. We then turn to financial services, such as banking and insurance.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.1</span> Capital Investments</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_p01">Prior to the acceptance of sustainable projects, socially responsible organizations have to evaluate the feasibility and sustainability of capital investments. Common financial methods historically employed in capital budgeting decisions include return on investment, payback period, unit cost of service, cost–benefit ratio, internal rate of return, and net present value. However, these methods are not always the best choices in sustainable finance since these methods do not explicitly account for cash flows associated with social, environmental, and economic impacts. These methods tend to externalize rather than internalize sustainable costs imposed on the society.</p>
    <div class="section" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Sustainability Valuation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p01">Valuation determines a company’s worth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sustainability valuation</a><span class="glossdef">A methodology for demonstrating how sustainability adds value to a corporation. To date, no specific set of financial metrics has been established for demonstrating the impact on company performance.</span></span> shows how sustainability adds value to the business. Currently, no existing methodology is considered adequate for sustainability valuation. This has led to much debate surrounding the best way to measure sustainability valuation within the firm. A recent McKinsey &amp; Company survey shows that executives believe that improvements in social, environmental, and governance performance create value; however, they do not agree on how much or how to measure it.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_001">McKinsey &amp; Company (2009).</span> Naturally, respondents agree that it would be helpful if companies reporting on sustainability performance would quantify financial impact, measure business opportunities as well as risks, and be transparent about methodology.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_002">McKinsey &amp; Company (2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p02">Research has shown that nonfinancial measures are the leading indicators of a firm’s future financial performance.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_003">Frigo (2002).</span> Additionally, research shows that firms listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index consistently outperform firms not listed on the Index. Thus, determining appropriate sustainability valuation metrics is particularly critical in this time of increasing emphasis on sustainability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p03">Given the importance of sustainability valuation but the lack of standardized approaches, several efforts have been made to identify or develop appropriate valuation metrics. In a recent effort to valuate sustainability performance, qualitative reports of progress were analyzed and converted to five common financial metrics: ratio analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, rules of thumb valuation, economic value-added analysis, and option pricing.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_004">Yachnin &amp; Associates and Sustainable Investment Group Ltd. (2006).</span> Other traditional financial approaches used include cost–benefit ratios and net present value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s01_p04">Yet it is commonly agreed that existing financial metrics are insufficient to capture the real value of sustainability. As a result, a number of new approaches and methods have been proposed: deliberative monetary valuation, social multicriteria evaluation, three-stage multicriteria analysis, multicriteria mapping, deliberative mapping, and stakeholder decision/dialogue analysis.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_005">Stagl (2007); International Finance Corporation CommDev (2009).</span> Yet another approach, the Financial Valuation Tool for Sustainability Investments,<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_006">International Finance Corporation CommDev (2009).</span> has been developed specifically for the extractive industries (mining, gas and oil exploration, etc.) and could serve as an example for other industries. Until appropriate methods are developed and widely adopted, businesses are left to use common financial metrics.</p>

Return on investment, payback period, and unit cost of service can be utilized in cases that have explicit costs and revenues related to sustainable investment. The use of basic capital budgeting tools, such as internal rate of return, net present value, and cost–benefit ratio, will require some adjustments and cautious use in order to accommodate sustainability analysis. Total cost accounting and life cycle costing analysis are excellent tools for a comprehensive analysis of sustainability-related investments (see <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch08#landrum_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Accounting"</a> for a full discussion).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Once capital budgeting projects are analyzed, selected, and prioritized, there may exist various outside financing options for sustainability-related projects.

State and federal regulations related to renewable energy have resulted in state and federal rebates, performance-based incentives, tax credits, tax incentives, power-purchasing agreements, revolving loan funds, and grants. Among some of the incentives you may find at the DSIRE Web site are tax rebates of up to $350,000 per entity to governmental agencies that purchase alternative fuel vehicles for business and official activities. Manufacturers of vehicles designed to operate on alternative fuels or hybrid diesel/electric may get financing assistance from the Alternative Fuels Conversion Program (AFCP). The AFCP will generally fund up to 50% of the additional cost of purchasing hybrid diesel or electric vehicles instead of a regular vehicle. As a result of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, additional sources of financing for investments in sustainability projects will become available.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s01_s02_p03">Another option is performance contracting. Performance contracting is considered a remodeling or construction financing method whereby the business does not pay up front for energy efficiency projects to be integrated into the current project budget but rather finances projects through guaranteed energy savings expected in the future.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">As we discuss capital investments and socially responsible investments, it is appropriate that we discuss how to measure corporate performance. Whereas businesses have traditionally assessed corporate performance through financial measures, there is growing emphasis to adopt a long-range and broader perspective that includes nonfinancial measures. There is much support for adopting more comprehensive strategic corporate performance measurement systems. Research has shown that nonfinancial measures are often the leading indicators that drive lagging financial performance.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_014">Frigo (2002).</span> Furthermore, nonfinancial indicators can provide a link between current activities and future financial performance of the firm.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_015">Frigo (2002).</span> Indeed, a triple bottom line orientation requires the inclusion of nonfinancial indicators of company performance.</p>

Organizations select unique indicators within each area that are directly linked to the organization’s strategic goals. Indicators often selected include employee training and corporate culture attitudes, internal business processes, customer requirement conformance and satisfaction, and risk assessment and cost–benefit data. As a management system, it helps identify measures to be taken by providing feedback concerning external outcomes related to internal processes. This allows for the alignment of daily business activities with long-term organizational goals and performance.</p>

Companies with fewer emissions than its permits can make money by selling their excess permits or carbon credits to another company; conversely, companies with more emissions than their permits allow must purchase additional permits.

In a carbon tax, the government translates the price per ton of carbon into a tax on nonrenewable fuels, such as natural gas or oil. Rather than externalizing the costs of emissions from these energy sources, the carbon tax is an attempt to internalize costs and make consumers pay for the ultimate environmental damage resulting from the choice to use nonrenewable energy sources. </p>

With the concerted effort of 11 of the world’s largest private banks and the anticorruption organization Transparency International, the Wolfsberg Anti-Money Laundering Principles for Private Banking (Wolfsberg Principles for short) were established in 2000. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Wolfsberg Principles</a><span class="glossdef">Nonbinding guidelines that deal primarily with appropriate monetary dealings between bankers and their customers. </span></span> provide guidelines specifically dealing with antimoney laundering, antiterrorism funding, and the identification and examination of unusual or suspicious activities. The principles also cover diverse policies that pertain to knowing your customers, especially for relationships between high net worth individuals and the financial institutions. So far, they are the best set of nonbinding guidelines concerning appropriate dealing between private bankers and global clients. Wolfsberg Principles deal primarily with appropriate monetary dealings between bankers and their customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p04">A sustainability development program in banking would involve the adoption and incorporation of the Wolfsberg Principles and the Equator Principles into the banking business practices. The adoption of both of those principles by financial institutions gives rise to the opportunity for the provision of funding to ecologically friendly, socially disadvantaged, and economically underserved communities and sectors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p05"><em class="emphasis">Sustainable Development Labeling Project</em>. Significant progress has also been made to improve the quality of investment information provided by financial institutions. For example, French bank Caisse d’Epargne has recently launched a sustainable development labeling system, Bénéfices Futur, to rate savings, loan, and insurance products based on the impacts of financial risk, social responsibility, and ecological changes.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_019">Groupe Caisse d’Epargne (2008).</span> The labeling system ranks bank products based on green marketing of products, accessibility of products, and the bank’s investments in and donations to socially responsible sectors and projects that support public interest causes. The labeling system also rates financial products that help to identify gaps between actual and perceived coverage and specify deductibles and effective time periods. Caisse d’Epargne’s sharing of the labeling system with other banks facilitates the spread of sustainability efforts in the banking industry.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Categories of Sustainable Financing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Green financing. </em>Sustainable financing can be classified as either <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">green financing</a><span class="glossdef">Attractive financing, a lower interest rate, tax incentives, or tax rebates for environmentally friendly investments and investments in green funds or bonds. </span></span> or social financing.<em class="emphasis"> </em>Greenfinancing enables investors to finance green projects less expensively, by offering attractive financing, a lower interest rate or tax incentives, and rebates for environmentally friendly investments and investment in green funds or bonds. An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">energy-efficient mortgage (EEM)</a><span class="glossdef">A green financing measure in which adjustments are made to standard mortgage measures for energy-efficient houses.</span></span> is an example of a green finance opportunity. In the EEM case, lenders can make an adjustment to the loan-to-value and stretch debt-to-income qualifying ratios for borrowers with energy-efficient houses because of the projected monthly energy savings. For widespread adoption of green projects, financial institutions, residents, builders, and local government need to be equipped with affordable sustainability knowledge and practical information on how to finance those projects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p02"><em class="emphasis">Social finance</em>. Apart from being green, sustainable finance also involves social finance activities that enhance local communities and social development. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social finance</a><span class="glossdef">Investment capital made available to positive social, economic, and environmental activities that enhance local communities and social development.</span></span> enables the channeling of investment capital to deliver positive social, economic, and environmental returns for the long run and for a global community. These channels include, but are not limited to, community investing, social enterprise lending, sustainable business, philanthropic grant making, and program-related investments. The Center for the Development of Social Finance is a nonprofit education and research organization that strives to expand awareness of social finance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Microfinancing</a><span class="glossdef">A type of social financing in which women, minorities, and low-income borrowers are provided with access to capital.</span></span> has gained great exposure recently as a special variety of social financing. Microfinancing is access to capital for women, minorities, and low-income borrowers who are not able to access loans from traditional resources. Microfinancing provides smaller loans with favorable terms and, for some programs, requires no or little collateral. Microfinancing seeks to aid in the revitalization of urban and rural communities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p04">Some states have sustainable microloan fund programs for underserved sectors, low-income communities, small businesses, and farmers. For example, the Strolling of the Heifer’s microloan fund offers loans anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 for terms up to 3 to 5 years. Despite the relatively low budget, such programs are a good investment in the future health of the entire serviced region.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_020">Strolling of the Heifers (2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p05">Microfinancing also involves making small loans (or microloans) to low-income businesses to stimulate economic growth in less developed countries. Grameen Bank, Kiva, and Prosper are examples of successful microfinance enterprises. Grameen Bank offers no-collateral microloans to 7.5 million women in Bangladesh. Dr. Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for this nonprofit microfinancing concept.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p06">Both Kiva and Prosper provide Internet microcredit to support sustainable causes. Kiva enables quick access to funds for small entrepreneurs especially in Indonesia and India. The average loan from Kiva is around $110 to be repaid in 6 to 12 months with no interest charged. Fifty percent of those borrowers in India were able to graduate out of poverty with the help of Kiva.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_021">Malhotra (2008).</span> Prosper links suppliers and demanders of funds in the developed and developing world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Community Development Financial Institutions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s03_p01">As an integral member of communities, financial institutions provide support for sustainable community social and economic development and ecological conservation. Specializing in promoting economic and community development, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Community Development Financial Institutions</a><span class="glossdef">Financial institutions such as banks, credit unions, loan funds, and development venture capital companies that provide financing to small businesses and housing and community facilities projects that revitalize economically distressed communities.</span></span> provide financing to small businesses and housing and community facilities projects that revitalize economically distressed communities. There are four types of community development financial institutions: community development banks, community development credit unions, community development loan funds, and community development venture capital companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s03_p02"><em class="emphasis">Community Development Banks</em>. Community development banks are for-profit banks committed to socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable community development. ShoreBank is the largest and most well-known community development bank in the United States and is the only one that takes into consideration all three dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, and environmental). ShoreBank opened in 1973 in Chicago and currently boasts $2.4 billion in assets and $4.2 million in net income with offices and businesses around the country and internationally; it is the nation’s first community development and environmental banking corporation. ShoreBank defines its triple bottom line mission as profitability, community development impact, and conservation. Community development banks exist around the world, the most notable of which is Grameen Bank, as discussed under the topic of social finance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s03_p03"><em class="emphasis">Community Development Credit Unions</em>. Community development credit unions (CDCU) are nonprofit, cooperatively owned, government-regulated, tax-exempt and insured financial institutions specializing in social financing. They serve low- and moderate-income people and communities by providing below-market-rate small loans to imperfect or no credit history borrowers and by offering financial education for its members. Major funding for CDCU institutions comes from banks, foundations, and other investors for deposits to support their work. Through partnerships with the private sector and participation in outreach and government programs, CDCU institutions are able to leverage community revitalization efforts. Federally chartered CDCU institutions are state regulated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s03_p04"><em class="emphasis">Community Development Loan Funds</em>. Community development loan funds provide loan funds for businesses, nonprofits, and underserved areas for the purpose of economic development. Loan funds provide financing to traditionally unqualified borrowers who would use the funds for advancing sustainable actions. These loan funds require collateral, but they have flexible payment schedules. The government’s sustainable development loan fund offers low interest loans up to $500,000 to businesses for green projects like utilizing sustainable resources, producing recyclable finished products, and installing pollution prevention procedures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s05_s03_p05"><em class="emphasis">Community Development Venture Capital</em>. Community development venture capital (CDVC) funds provide equity capital to entrepreneurial companies that will ultimately benefit low-income people and distressed communities. The amount of the investment funding from CDVC funds is generally less than that of their traditional counterparts. The average CDVC fund investment for small businesses was about $331,000 per company in 2000.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_022">Ward and Patterson (2003).</span> Kentucky Highlands Investment Corporation (KHIC) runs a very successful rural economic development program. KHIC’s ventures contribute at least 68% of the net growth of manufacturing jobs in Kentucky Highland’s nine target counties from 1970 to 1990. The positive entrepreneurial capitalism spurs from the enhanced availability of community venture financing.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_023">Ward and Patterson (2003).</span></p>

<span class="title-prefix">4.6</span> Sustainable Insurance</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p01">The insurance industry is particularly interested in sustainability, given the impact that climate change has had on this industry’s profitability. In fact, climate change is the number one risk to the insurance industry.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_024">Ernst &amp; Young (2008).</span> According to an Ernst &amp; Young study,<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_025">Ernst &amp; Young (2008).</span> climate change could result in increased mortality and health problems, increased environmentally related litigation, increased conflicts over control of resources, and negative impacts on capital markets.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p02">According to a 2005 study by the Association of British Insurers, if carbon dioxide emission levels are doubled, the capital requirement for insurers could increase by $76 billion, which is an 80%–90% increase due to the increased risk of tropical cyclones in the United States and Japan.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_026">Association of British Insurers (2005).</span> Allianz, Europe’s largest insurer, estimated that losses due to climate change could be as high as $400 billion. In addition to property loss, insured companies may face carbon-regulatory risks governing its investment and insurance policies on green projects. Given these challenges, the industry is addressing the concept of sustainability and is taking notice of social, environmental, and economic impacts.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p03">Many insurers have increased their focus on financial risk management. Yet proactive insurers are making progress in developing both investment strategies to “participate in the ‘green’ revolution in the financial markets” and in creating new climate-friendly products to address climate change risk.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_027">Mills (2007).</span> Many of these financial products deal with green building, hurricane-resistant design, promotion of alternate fuels, and sustainable driving practices to reduce carbon emissions. Proactive insurers encourage the insured to participate in the insurance sustainability effort.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p04">Insurance companies play an important role in social, economic, and ecologically friendly sustainability. Swiss Re has sold weather-risk products to 320,000 small farmers in India. For renewable energy-related insurance products, Willis Holdings covers potential power underproduction of wind farms. As a pioneer in offering green-building policies, Lexington Insurance Company’s new policies will pay the insured to rebuild a home using environmentally friendly and energy-efficient materials after it is destroyed by natural disasters.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_028">Tergesen (2008).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p05">In Japan, Sompo Japan Insurance and Tokio Marine Nichido Fire Insurance Co., Ltd. have given premium discounts to 10 million policyholders who drive low-emitting cars. Travelers and Farmers cut 10% off the policy premium for hybrid cars. Progressive and GMAC insurance companies offer pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) policies in parts of the United States. In the U.S., automobiles account for 25% of all GHG emissions and it is anticipated that implementing PAYD policies and hybrid vehicle incentives could reduce emissions by 10%.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_029">Bordoff (2008).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p06">Increasingly, insurance companies have utilized exclusion clauses—tightened conditions to foster the right decisions by customers. Some insurance companies limit liabilities for emitters of greenhouse gases and for companies that do not have a climate mitigation plan in place. “Development and establishment of business-continuity management (BCM) procedures [is used as] a prerequisite for adding on business interruption coverage to a company’s property insurance.”<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_030">Ross, Mills, and Hecht (2007).</span> As one of the world’s largest re-insurers, Swiss Re, Munich Re requires disclosure of a company’s climate strategy in their directors and officers insurance application.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn04_031">Makower (2005).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch04_s06_p07">As this chapter has demonstrated, the finance function, as well as the finance industry, is greatly impacted by sustainability considerations. Every aspect of finance, from investments to banking and from trading to insurance and risk, requires new thinking when we consider the social, economic, and environmental impact of business.</p>
