<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 8</span> Accounting</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_p01">Accounting for the sustainable business extends beyond traditional financial and managerial accounting. Rather than externalizing the social and environmental costs of doing business, sustainability accounting seeks to honestly track, measure, and report direct and indirect economic, social, and environmental impacts of the business’s operations. In other words, sustainability accounting seeks to internalize costs that have heretofore been externalized. Sustainability accounting may be known by other terms, such as social accounting, environmental accounting, social and environmental accounting, or social and ethical accounting, auditing, and reporting. Accounting specifically focused on greenhouse gas emissions is referred to as carbon accounting. Furthermore, reporting the results may be termed sustainability reporting, corporate social responsibility reporting, triple bottom line reporting, and nonfinancial reporting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_p02">Prior to beginning any attempt to measure a company’s triple bottom line impact, it should be clear what principles of corporate behavior the company aspires to follow and identify specific standards that support the principles.<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn08_001">Landrum, Daily, and Vjin (2009).</span> Principles and standards will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch09#landrum_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Next Steps: Sustainability Strategy"</a>, but it is important to understand that identification of principles and standards is a precursor to the selection of tracking, measuring, and reporting tools for sustainability accounting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_p03">Since examining nonfinancial performance of the business is a voluntary initiative, a myriad of options have emerged for sustainability accounting, and the realm of possibilities can be quite overwhelming. In this chapter, we will focus only on areas specific to accounting (measurement and accounting tools, reporting, assurance, and stakeholder engagement) and will address senior-level management issues (principles and standards) in a later discussion (see <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch09#landrum_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Next Steps: Sustainability Strategy"</a>).</p>

Measurement and accounting tools refer to calculators and formulas and are not to be confused with standards, benchmarks, or thresholds for achievement (to be discussed in <a class="xref" href="landrum_1.0-ch09#landrum_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Next Steps: Sustainability Strategy"</a>). These measurement and accounting tools allow the company to measure its current behavior to establish a baseline, to set goals for improvement, and to measure future behavior to determine progress. This chapter will introduce you to the most common tools used by sustainable businesses.</p>

LCAs do not assess the overall environmental performance of a company; they are focused only on the product or process under review. Nonetheless, LCA is a useful measurement tool for the sustainable business to help determine impacts of various products and services.

    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_s03_p01">The final issues to consider in sustainability accounting are auditing and assurance as well as stakeholder engagement throughout the entire process. Sometimes referred to as a social (or environmental) audit, an ethical audit, or monitoring, auditing and assurance allows verification that proper checks and balances are in place to support the claims of the organization. There are currently two general assurance standards available, the AA1000 Assurance Standard and the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, and one stakeholder engagement standard, AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard.</p>

Stakeholder engagement is a process to promote cooperation between the organization and all its stakeholders as a means to involve and respond to the interests of stakeholders. AccountAbility<span class="footnote" id="landrum_1.0-fn08_009">AccountAbility (2005a, 2005b).</span> has issued the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard; however, it appears that most organizations develop their own stakeholder engagement process.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="landrum_1.0-ch08_s04_p01">In recent years, overhead costs have become an increasingly significant part of product cost.

That is, sustainable businesses are looking beyond internal costs and are including broader considerations such as costs associated with the entire value chain or, as discussed in past chapters, the costs associated with cradle to cradle activities. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sustainability costing</a><span class="glossdef">A method of financial reporting that assesses the financial costs of products and services over their lifetime and throughout the supply chain in lieu of passing along those costs to society and the environment.</span></span> seeks to internalize those costs that have been historically externalized.
